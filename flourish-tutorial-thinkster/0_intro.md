# What is Flourish?

{intro-video: flourish-intro}

## Flourish is full, design to deployment app tutorial

Flourish is a mood journal app. More importantly, learning to build Flourish is
the best way to get started learning app development because we think the best
way to get a broad understanding of what it takes to develop an app is to go 
through an entire app tutorial using various frameworks and techniques. We believe
that it can be difficult to learn to build apps by reading about specific classes
or frameworks and would rather get on building a whole app and seeking out deep
dives if you're still curious. 

## You'll learn

* Location Services
* Auto Layout
* CloudKit
* Encryption
* Animation
* Unit Testing 

## Constantly Updating

We want this to be comprehensive and thorough, while being incredibly easy for
beginners to go through. If you think something can be made better or is unclear,
please comment and we will be happy to revise this tutorial over time. 

## Version Compatibility

Swift is constantly evolving. Make sure your Xcode is compatible with the version
of Swift we'll be using. 
<strong>As of March 3, 2014, this tutorial is going to use Swift 1.2 conventions and syntax </strong>


## Creating our Xcode Project

Let's do some setup. 

{video: flourish_setting_up}

{x: open_new_project}
Open Xcode and select "create new Xcode project" 

{x: project_setup}
Select single page app and set the language to Swift. Set the device to iPhone 
and let's name this project "Flourish-Teaching" to distinguish from the source 
code, which is called "Flourish."
